        # NOTE: SOURCE FRESHNESS DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK TOO WELL WITH BIGQUERY PUBLIC DATASET, SEE BELOW RECOMMENDED SOLUTION
            # Hereâ€™s what I did to get the snapshot freshness exercise to work with the BQ public dataset
            # replicated the public dataset into my own BQ project.  this persisted the _batched_at column
            # Updated my source in the project to use this new replica and use the _batched_at column as my loaded_at_field
            # Verified that warn/error worked as expected when using the dbt source snapshot-freshness command.
